<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Dunk 👋</h1>
And I’m not the cat in the profile picture, in case you were wondering 😄  
I’m a self-taught full-stack software developer working with databases, backends, and frontends.

I enjoy building well-structured, functional applications and understanding how systems work end to end. I work mainly with modern web technologies and relational databases, and I’m constantly improving my skills through hands-on projects and continuous learning.

I’m especially interested in low-level and high-performance systems, and my goal is to specialize in **Rust** while continuing to grow as a versatile full-stack developer.
